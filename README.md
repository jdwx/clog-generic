# clog-generic
An updated generic version of the original Clog written in C++.

## How to use

This includes two programs, clogd and clog.

clogd reads from its standard input and writes to a circular buffer
in POSIX shared memory given by the command line:

`clogd /shared-path/logfile`

The clog program is used to read this output:

`clog /shared-path/logfile`

Without any flags, clog reads and outputs the current buffer contents, then 
exits.

The following flags are supported by clog:

* -f = Read the buffer contents, then wait for more data to arrive, displaying the result indefinitely.  (Similar to `tail -n 9999999999 -f`.)

* -z = Ignore the existing buffer contents, then wait for new data to arrive, displaying the result indefinitely.  (Similar to `tail -n 0 f`.)

* -r = Remove a shared memory log and then exit.
